# Chapter-4-Lab-3

Lab Goal :   This lab was designed to teach you more about recursion.   

Lab Description :   luckyThrees will return a count of the 3s in the number unless the 3 is at the start.  A 3 at the start of the number does not count.   
	/* luckyThrees will return the count of 3s in the number
	 * unless the 3 is at the front and then it does not count
	 * 3 would return 0
	 * 31332  would return 2
	 * 134523 would return 2
	 * 3113  would return 1
	 * 13331 would return 3
	 * 777337777  would return 2
	 * the solution to this problem must use recursion
